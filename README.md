# pandas_challenge
In this modules challenge I was able to clean the given data sets and perform valuable insights on the data that I had extracted. I was able to determine what types of schools in the data set perform better overall, which schools performed better depending on the student population size, and much more.

The sources I used for this challenge were mostly tips and and small code snippets I recieved from the Xpert Learning Assistant, with a little debugging help from the BCS Learning Assistance.
